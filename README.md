### How the game play:
- Guess what letter I'm thinking of. Player will start typing letter they want to guest
- To Wins: (# of times the player has guessed the letter correctly)
- If Losses: (# of times the player has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)
- Total Guesses Left: (# of guesses left)
- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the player typed)

## Problem has came across:
How to work with the addEventListener() method when user input random letter

## How to solve it:
By adding event listeners to any DOM object not only HTML elements. i.e the window object.
The addEventListener() method makes it easier to control how the event reacts to bubbling.

## Technical approach:
When using the addEventListener() method, the JavaScript is separated from the HTML markup, for better readability and allows you to add event listeners even when you do not control the HTML markup.
