# Psychic-Game
### What is Psychic-Game:

It is an app randomly picks a letter, and the user has to guess which letter the app chose. Put the following text on your page:

Steps to follow:


- Guess what letter I'm thinking of


- Wins: (# of times the user has guessed the letter correctly)


- Losses: (# of times the user has failed to guess the letter correctly after exhausting all guesses)


- Guesses Left: (# of guesses left)


- Your Guesses So Far: (the specific letters that the user typed)


- When the player wins, increase the Wins counter and start the game over again.


- When the player loses, increase the Losses counter
